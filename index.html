                   This website will serve as a record of my progress as a web developer. I begin this journey as a hobbyist with a fair knowledge of HTML and CSS, and this portfolio is a showcase of my development towards becoming a professional.

                    For the last ten years, I have worked as a technical writer for an environmental engineering firm, and while it's been interesting, I want to move into something new. About a year ago, I needed a website for my wedding, but I found the available wedding website templates lacking. So, I decided to build my own. It was frustrating, confusing, and difficult, but ultimately rewarding, and it sparked a new passion in me.

                   I was born in Georgia and moved around quite a bit as an Air Force brat, but I've lived in Utah long enough (24 years!) that I think of it as home. I am married, I have a daughter, and I love being outdoors. I also love being lazy, so Netflix is a dear, dear friend. I have a degree in English Literature, I lean pretty far left, and I love to learn.
